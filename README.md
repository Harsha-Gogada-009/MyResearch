# üöó Lane Change Prediction using Deep Learning  
*A Comprehensive Analysis with LSTMs, Transformers, Informer, and GNNs*  

## üìÑ About the Paper  
This repository accompanies the research paper:  
**‚ÄúFrom LSTMs to Transformers and GNNs: A Comprehensive Analysis on Lane Change Trajectory Forecasting‚Äù**  

The study presents a comparative and hybrid evaluation of deep learning architectures for **lane change prediction in autonomous vehicles**, focusing on:  
- **Recurrent Models**: GRU, Bi-LSTM, Attention-LSTM  
- **Attention-based Models**: Transformer, Informer  
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** for spatial interactions  
- **Hybrid Architectures**: Informer+LSTM, Informer+GNN, Transformer+GNN  

We benchmarked these models on the **NGSIM real-world trajectory dataset** and analyzed them under:  
- Clean vs noisy data  
- Rich vs minimal feature sets  
- Computational efficiency (GPU/CPU memory, training time)  

üìå **Novelty**: First-of-its-kind comparative study of hybrid Informer-based models with RNNs and GNNs for real-world lane-change forecasting.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset (https://github.com/Harsha-Gogada-009/NGSIM-Datasets)
We use the **NGSIM dataset**, which contains high-resolution vehicle trajectory data including:  
- Local/Global X, Y positions  
- Velocity, acceleration  
- Vehicle class, length, width  
- Lane ID  
- Preceding / Following vehicles  
- Space & Time Headway  

Labels:  
- `0` = Left Lane Change  
- `1` = Lane Keeping  
- `2` = Right Lane Change

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology  
### Preprocessing  
- Normalization via z-score standardization  
- Fixed-length sliding windows for temporal modeling  
- Lane change labels derived from Lane_ID shifts  

### Models Implemented  
- **GRU & Bi-LSTM**: Sequential baselines  
- **Attention-LSTM**: Selective focus on critical timesteps  
- **Transformer**: Self-attention for temporal dependencies  
- **Informer**: ProbSparse attention for long sequence forecasting  
- **Hybrid Models**: Informer+LSTM, Informer+GNN
